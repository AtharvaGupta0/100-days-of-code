/* Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user's name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Name: Rahul, Age: 23
Output 1:
File created successfully! Data written to info.txt

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char name[100];
  int age;
  FILE *fp;

  printf("Enter your name: ");
  fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
  printf("Enter your age: ");
  scanf("%d", &age);

  fp = fopen("info.txt", "w");
  if (fp == NULL) {
    printf("Error creating file!\n");
    return 1;
  }
  fprintf(fp, "Name: %sAge: %d", name, age);
  fclose(fp);

  printf("File created successfully! Data written to info.txt\n");
  return 0;
